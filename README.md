# satellite-stamp

Tool to generate map images for Mongabay.

## Getting Started

In order to start modifying the app, please make sure to correctly configure your workstation:

1. Make sure you you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
2. (Optional) Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your different Node.js versions
3. (Optional) Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a text editor to benefit from automatic type checking
4. Configure your text editor with the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) plugins
5. Use the correct Node.js version for this app by running `nvm use`; if you didn't install NVM (step 2), then manually install the Node.js version described in `.nvmrc`
6. Install the dependencies: `yarn` (or `npm install`)
7. Run the server: `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`)

You can access a hot-reloaded version of the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The application is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The styles use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

A continuous deployment system is in place. Each time you push to the `master` branch, the application is deployed in GitHub Pages through a GitHub Action defined in `.github/workflows/build.yml`. You can see the status of the build in the “Actions” tab of the repository on GitHub.
